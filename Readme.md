Markdown is awesome but apparently it seems hard to highlight. This
plugin limits the scope significantly, choosing not to highlight things
like tables, unmarked code blocks, underlined titles, etc. that are more
expensive to highlight, and that I either don't use all that frequently
or don't really need syntax highlighting for.
